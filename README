= Proof of concept Rails loader

This is a small Sinatra app that will spin up multiple Rails apps on various ports based on a query parameter.

For example:

    http://localhost:4567/1 will spin up a Rails app on port 3001 and redirect to it.

== Usage

To start up the app, make sure you have sinatra and rails installed (gem install sinatra rails), then spin up the sinatra app:

    ruby manyrails.rb

Then go to the following address:

    http://localhost:4567/1

That will spin up the fist rails app and redirect you to it!

== Creating a new rails app

To use this, create a rails app in a subrailsN directory where N is a number between 0 and 9.

Then add the following to the top of your config.ru file in the new rails app:

    #\ -p 300N

Where N is the number of the app you used.
